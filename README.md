Early-life stress is linked to later cognitive deficits, but the circuit-level mechanisms that produce pattern-specific memory impairments remain unclear. We built a two-stage computational model in which axon-like tips grow in a two-dimensional chemoattractant (BDNF) field and form synapses, and the resulting recurrent network is probed with a rate-based attractor model. A ``trauma'' condition combines localized BDNF deprivation (negative Gaussian holes) with a transient cortisol pulse that reduces chemotactic sensitivity and increases stochastic tip motion; memory retention is tested for both spatially clustered and randomly distributed binary patterns across paired seeds. Contrary to a simple loss-of-connections view, trauma drives more erratic growth that yields hyper-connected, disorganized circuits with more long-range contacts and an increased spectral radius. Functionally, these architectures selectively impair the stability and retention of memories encoded by spatially co-located ensembles, while diffuse/random patterns are less affected and can show modest gains in some parameter regimes. A parameter sweep shows the largest cluster-local deficits when strong local BDNF deprivation coincides with high cortisol and particular spectral-scaling choices. The model links developmental stress to cognitive outcomes by implicating disrupted local circuit organization and mode delocalization, and it generates testable predictions about how early insults reshape attractor landscapes supporting spatially coherent memories.
